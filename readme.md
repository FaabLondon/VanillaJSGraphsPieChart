### JS Quiz

Start with a JSON object:

{
  "Lancaster Ward":32,
  "Oncology Ward":30,
  "Cardiac Care Ward":28,
  "Surgical HDU":26,
  "Ada Lovelace Ward":26
}

This describes a data set containing five items.
Each item has a label ("Ward") and a quantity ("Count").

# Challenge 1:
In Javascript with embedded CSS:
Display this as a table, with column headers, alignment and formatting similar to the enclosed screen capture.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zT68h2y.png" width="700"></p>

# Challenge 2:
Generate a .SVG element in the DOM depicting this as a bar chart or as a line chart.
For full credit, generate the file using JavaScript.
Alternatively, you may hand-craft the .SVG file.
Labels are optional for this exercise. We are more concerned with the process of composing the chart.


# Challenge 3:
completely optional, for extra credit:
Generate a .SVG element in the DOM, a pie chart with five segments reflecting these five items.
Labels are even more optional for this exercise.
This one may require some clever trickery, so it really is meant for extra credit and for your intellectual stimulation.


For all of these, of course, you may search for solutions on the Internet and make use of any sources you find, as long as you "understand and incorporate" rather than "cut and paste".
After all, that's how modern software development takes place!
We're interested in the conversation we will be able to have when you're finished.

Any JavaScript code should be plain vanilla JavaScript: no d3.js, no jquery, no React, etc.
